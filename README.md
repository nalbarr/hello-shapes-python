# hello-shapes-python
hello-shapes-python

This project is complementary to NA/NLA pairing for anchor project [hello-luke-java](https://github.com/nalbarr/hello-luke-java).

## Goals
- Understand how to set up a Python project, experiment with classes, functions
- Understand how to test

## How to run
- Run console program with main entry point
`python main.py`
- Run two unit tests
`python -m unittest -v tests.test_foo`
`python -m unittest -v tests.test_hello_shapes`

## Concepts

### Basic
- How does Python compare to your other experiences with Java and C#?
- Console program and main entry point; Where did the Java `static void main(string[] arg) {}` go?
- Reflect on compiling a program versus intepreting one
- How does declaring types differ?
- Classes; How does the self operator come into play?  Superclasses, Subclasses

### Intermediate
- Is there a concept of a Java/C# interface?
- What is a module? (e.g., __init__.py)

### Advanced
- How does a project structure differ from your other projects?
- How do you test you code?  What is a unit test?
- Python supports multiple inheritance.  What is a Mixin?
